						Hiring a freelancer is an easy and cost effective way of getting your job done.  Freeelancers and small businesses are able to offer lower rates than the broader market because they operate without many of the overheads of traditional business, such as office space, staffing costs and marketing.  Structured Thinking puts you in direct contact with the skills you need when you need them, saving you money and ensuring that your job takes prioity.
